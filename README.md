CakeFoundation
==============

* CakePHP 2.2.3 with Foundation CSS 3.2 'baked' in.

* This is a bare-bones configuration of CakePHP with Foundation CSS Framework in place for all your layout and views.
I've also included basic AppModel and AppControllers along with UserController to have initial user authentication 
in place and working.  Just import users.sql into your MySQL server.  

* Go to http://yoursite/register to add your first user
